        <p>SAUL GREENE: I am new to the programming world and loving it so far. I came to Code Fellows with no experience whatsoever and am astonished with the amount that I have been able to learn in such a short period of time. Both the classes and the students are great!</p>

        <p>FRAZIER MORK: I have been at Code Fellows for a while. Some of my hobbies include redundant grading of the word "done", pulling my hair out while helping people with CSS, and fixing git issues. I didnt know how much I loved computer programming until I was invited to work on Escape Code 201. I think my team deserves 100%. </p>
